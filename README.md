# SurveyWebsite

This is a survey webpage where you can create surveys, take surveys, view Survey results, and make, take, and see results of a daily question.
This project was a team project as a capstone for the class of 2021 at Centralia College. The colors are based on the school colors.

We used Microsoft Blazor as the framework to better leverage c# code inside the HTML pages.
SQL server for storing the survey results, user info, questions for surveys, and other things needed for operation.

The website and database was hosted on Azure, but after the capstone was over the student running it turned it off
