# SurveyWebsite

This is a survey webpage where you can create surveys, take surveys, view Survey results, and make, take, and see results of a daily question.
This project was a team project as a capstone for the class of 2021 at Centralia College. The colors are based on the school colors.

We used Microsoft Blazor as the framework to better leverage c# code inside the HTML pages.
SQL server for storing the survey results, user info, questions for surveys, and other things needed for operation.

Here is the first page that can lead to the question of the day.

The website works through stored procedures to send data to the database and linq to get data from the database.
